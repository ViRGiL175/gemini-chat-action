# Gemini Chat GitHub Action

This action allows you to interact with Google's Gemini API directly from your GitHub Actions workflows. You can send text prompts and system instructions to the Gemini model and receive its generated answer.

## Features

*   Sends text prompts to the Gemini API (model `gemini-2.5-flash` via `v1beta` endpoint).
*   Supports optional system-level instructions to guide the model's behavior.
*   Validates required inputs (`gemini-api-key`, `text`).
*   Ensures `curl` and `jq` are available in the runner environment, installing them if necessary (on Debian/Ubuntu and Alpine-based images).
*   Outputs the generated answer from Gemini.
*   Provides detailed console output including the full JSON response from the API (for debugging) and the extracted answer.

## Inputs

-   `gemini-api-key`
    -   **Description**: Your API key for the Google Gemini API.
    -   **Required**: `true`
-   `text`
    -   **Description**: The main text prompt to send to the Gemini model.
    -   **Required**: `true`
-   `system-instruction`
    -   **Description**: Optional system-level instructions to steer the model's behavior. This can include context, desired format, or examples.
    -   **Required**: `false`
    -   **Default**: `""`

## Outputs

-   `answer`
    -   **Description**: The text answer generated by Gemini.

## Usage Example

```yaml
name: Ask Gemini

on: [push]

jobs:
  chat_with_gemini:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: Call Gemini Action
        id: gemini_response
        uses: ViRGiL175/gemini-chat-action@main
        with:
          gemini-api-key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
          text: "Translate 'Hello, world!' to Spanish."
          system-instruction: "You are a helpful translation assistant."

      - name: Show Gemini's Answer
        run: echo "Gemini says: ${{ steps.gemini_response.outputs.answer }}"
```

## Development

The action is a composite action, defined in `action.yml`. It uses `curl` to make requests to the Gemini API and `jq` to parse the JSON response.

### Dependencies:
*   `curl`
*   `jq`

The action attempts to install these if they are not found on the runner, supporting `apt-get` (Debian/Ubuntu) and `apk` (Alpine). For other systems, ensure these tools are pre-installed on your runner.
